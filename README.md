# DataTransporter
Data Transfer ORACLE DB to PostgreSQL

Console App: the purpose of this project I developed using C#, was to
efficiently process documents with a number of approximately 120 thousand documents
and to store these documents in an organized manner in a PostgreSQL database. I
processed the blob data in the Oracle database, converted it into appropriate formats
(.pdf, .udf etc.) in a specific folder structure and saved it. I stored these converted documents
in the database with a structure containing the file path and name.
